# vision-lib

Java Library implementing basic neural network functionality, including:
- Backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent algorithms
- Different activation functions such as ReLU and Sigmoid
- Easily customizeable network topology
- Softmax/Cross-Entropy Loss
- Rudimentary 'feature visualization' via gradient descent on the input
